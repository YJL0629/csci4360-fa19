# Workshop 0 Materials

In this folder you'll find all the materials related to Workshop 0.

It's pretty much just the Jupyter `.ipynb` file, a folder of images used in the
notebook, and this README. All the material of interest is in the notebook file.

## To run

For those of you new to Jupyter notebooks: simply clicking on the notebook
file will only give you a _static_, _noninteractive_ view. If you want to
actually run the notebook live (like I did in lecture), you'll need to:

 1. Download the `.ipynb` file from the repository onto your computer.
 2. Open up a command prompt window and navigate to the folder where you downloaded
the `.ipynb` file.
 3. Run the command: `jupyter notebook`

A web browser window should pop up, and you should see the `.ipynb` file there.
Simply click the file and it should run!

If you have trouble getting this to work, post a ticket in the "Issues" tab above.
